After Champions fourth edition was released in 1989, a stripped-down version of its ruleset with no superhero or other genre elements was released as The Hero System Rulesbook in 1990. As a spinoff of Champions, the Hero System is considered to have started with 4th edition (as it is mechanically identical to Champions 4th edition), rather than on its own with a 1st edition. However, the first three editions of the game are typically referred to as Champions, rather than the Hero System, as the game for its first three editions was not sold as a universal toolkit, instead largely focusing on superheroes.\r\n\r\nThe Hero System uses Champions' key system features. Tasks are resolved using three six-sided dice and power effects (especially damage) are resolved by rolling a number of dice based on the power's strength.\r\n\r\nLike Champions, it uses tool-kit approach to creating effects. While the system does have more typical features of many RPGs, such as a skill system, most abilities in the Hero System rules are listed as a generic \"powers\". Most powers are meant to be able to model a vast number of potential effects. When creating a character, a player decides on what effect they wish to create, then constructs this effect by consulting the powers in the rulebook. Most powers have a set of modifiers that alter its base performance to more finely-tune its representation of the effect desired. Each such modifier makes the power more or less capable, and correspondingly more or less expensive to purchase with character points (the \"currency\" used to buy powers; see the section following). The result is that many effects are possible from the exact same base power. For example, while systems such as Dungeons & Dragons would list a wide variety of separate ranged attack powers that deal damage (such as a fireball, a lightning bolt, an acid spray, a magic missile, and dozens more), the vast majority of such effects in the Hero System would be constructed out of the same base two powers, \"Blast\" or \"Killing Attack\".", "original_publisher": "e86ea378-40ea-475b-839d-f7f45171ec34", "image": "", "isbn": null, "publication_date": null, "ogl_license": false, "system_url": null}}, {"model": "game_catalog.gamesystem", "pk": "4e198e84-6435-4c8c-a12d-a779ae96faf8", "fields": {"created": "2018-08-27T17:03:03.734Z", "modified": "2018-08-27T17:03:03.784Z", "name": "Fiasco", "description": "Fiasco is a role-playing game by Jason Morningstar, independently published by Bully Pulpit Games.

It has been used for four published games and one published preview to date, and the design principles are in the Cortex Plus Hacker's Guide, a book of advice in how to create new games using Cortex Plus, and list of new games produced via kickstarter. According to the Hacker's Guide there are three basic 'flavors' of Cortex Plus; Action, Drama, and Heroic.\r\n\r\nUnlike the Cortex System, Cortex Plus is a roll and keep system in which you roll one die from each category and keep the two highest dice in your dice pool. What goes into your dice pool is whatever is considered important for the game you are playing - but different stories have different things they consider important so the implementation of the system has been different for each game so far. All versions of Cortex Plus use standard polyhedral dice and the normal dice notation ranging from d4 (a 4 sided tetrahedral die) to d12 (a 12-sided dodecahedral die), and narratively notable features are given dice from this list, with d6 being the default.\r\n\r\nIn all cases Cortex Plus uses dice pools ranging from d4 (terrible) to d12 (the best possible), and every die in your pool that rolls a natural 1 (called an 'Opportunity') doesn't count toward your total and causes some form of negative consequence which, depending on the game, either creates a complication for the characters to overcome or adds to the Doom Pool that provides the Game Master resources within the scene. Adding a d4 to your dice pool is considered a penalty because it isn't likely to roll one of your best two die results and there's such a high chance of rolling a 1.\r\n\r\nMost versions of Cortex Plus (other than Smallville) give the character a set of three distinctions that they can choose to add to their dice pool either as a d8 to assist them, or as a d4 to hinder them - but they gain a plot point by using the d4 option.\r\n\r\nEquipment is normally handled by enabling the character to do things (you can't shoot someone without a gun) but where it is especially notable it is given a dice rating and added to the dice pool as an asset. And things that get in the way are treated similarly, and added to the dice pool as complications.\r\n\r\nCortex Plus also uses Plot Points - the normal uses of which are to establish something as notable (turning it into an asset), power a stunt or ability, to add a die to your roll, or to keep an additional die after you have rolled.", "original_publisher": "8307e988-77ab-4245-b88f-4e4a4913f2e0", "image": "", "isbn": null, "publication_date": null, "ogl_license": false, "system_url": null}}, {"model": "game_catalog.gamesystem", "pk": "93a0bedd-e369-4c1b-acf1-c75c97e9dafb", "fields": {"created": "2018-08-27T16:30:02.913Z", "modified": "2018-08-27T16:30:02.950Z", "name": "Basic Role-Playing System", "description": "Basic Role-Playing (BRP) is a role-playing game system which originated in the RuneQuest fantasy role-playing game.

These moves can allow them abilities above and beyond the normal, like the Hypnosis ability of the Monsterhearts Vampire, can give them additional resources, such as the Apocalypse World Driver's \"My other car is a Tank,\" or may simply make them better at moves everyone has access to, like the Apocalypse World Gunlugger's \"Insano like Drano.\"", "original_publisher": "2dd3ed9f-ced9-42df-b5a5-a10d47f9b4f9", "image": "", "isbn": null, "publication_date": null, "ogl_license": false, "system_url": null}}, {"model": "game_catalog.gamesystem", "pk": "db41e813-9275-4b88-a4e5-5ccc322b6c92", "fields": {"created": "2018-08-27T16:57:57.503Z", "modified": "2018-08-27T16:57:57.540Z", "name": "Adventure Game Engine (AGE)", "description": "The Adventure Game Engine (AGE) is the system that powers Green Ronin's Dragon Age RPG.

It was subsequently used for their licensed Battlestar Galactica and Supernatural RPGs, and brought out as a stand-alone system in the Cortex System Role Playing Game book (also called the Cortex Classic System Role Playing Game). Serenity, using the Cortex System, was the 2005 Origins Award Gamer's Choice Role Playing Game of the Year.\r\n\r\nNote that despite the similar name, the Cortex System is not the Cortex Plus system, also produced by Margaret Weis Productions.\r\n\r\nThe system uses dice with 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 sides, described with the standard role-playing game notation of d2, d4, d6, d8, and so on, and the basic resolution system involves adding up the total on all your relevant dice and comparing it to a static target number. The three parts of your dice pool are your relevant Attributes (Agility, Strength, Vitality, Alertness, Intelligence, and Willpower) which range from d4 to d12+d4, your relevant Skill (from a list of 22) which range from 0 to d12, and any relevant Assets (positive character traits) or Complications (negative traits). Situational advantages can be represented either by changing the target difficulty number or increasing or reducing the number of faces on the dice rolled.\r\n\r\nThe Cortex System also uses Plot Points, which increase characters' survivability and give players greater control over events in the game. Players can spend Plot Points to gain extra dice when making a die roll, reduce the damage from an attack, or even make changes to the storyline. Some Assets also require the expenditure of Plot Points. At the end of a game session, excess Plot Points are converted to Advancement Points, which a player spends to improve his or her character's abilities.", "original_publisher": "8307e988-77ab-4245-b88f-4e4a4913f2e0", "image": "", "isbn": null, "publication_date": null, "ogl_license": false, "system_url": null}}, {"model": "game_catalog.gamesystem", "pk": "e622796e-03eb-4d9c-a5fc-a7787bfb71d7", "fields": {"created": "2018-08-27T16:31:34.396Z", "modified": "2018-08-27T16:31:34.439Z", "name": "GURPS", "description": "The Generic Universal RolePlaying System, or GURPS, is a tabletop role-playing game system designed to allow for play in any game setting.
